# Tic-Tac-Toe Q-Learning AI

## Project Overview
This project builds a Tic-Tac-Toe game where an AI learns to play using
Q-learning (a type of reinforcement learning). The AI starts making random
moves and, after many games, learns which moves lead to wins, losses, or ties.

## How to Run

### 1. Train the AI

In a terminal inside this folder:
